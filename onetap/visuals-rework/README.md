## Kitkat visuals
---

#### Disclaimer

This plugin was not made with the intentions of re-creating another
software provider's visuals but, instead, to revamp Onetap's visuals
with a more minimalistic look. In order to not disobey the forum's rules,
the script automatically renders a watermark (in the top right corner),
containing the name of the software, your forum username and more additional
info. 

THIS WATERMARK SHOULD NOT BE EDITED OR REMOVED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND
DOING SO WILL PUT YOURSELF IN RISK OF GETTING BANNED FOR PASSING AS ANOTHER
SOFTWARE PROVIDER.

#### Terms of usage
- This plugin's watermark must not be removed or modified in a way that makes the average
viewer not distinguish Onetap from another cheat provider.
- This plugin must not be released in the forums, specially under someone else's name.
- This plugin must not be commercialized under any circumstances. Including it in a javascript pack is 
tolerable, as long as the pack itself isn't the product.
